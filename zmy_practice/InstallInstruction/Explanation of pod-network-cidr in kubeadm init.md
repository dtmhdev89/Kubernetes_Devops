You're asking about the choice of 10.244.0.0/16 for the pod-network-cidr in the kubeadm init command, rather than 192.168.0.0/16. Here's a breakdown:

* **pod-network-cidr**: This parameter specifies the IP address range that will be assigned to Pods in your Kubernetes cluster. Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, and they each need a unique IP address to communicate.  
* **10.244.0.0/16**:  
  * 10.244.0.0: This is an IP address within the private IP address range of 10.0.0.0/8.  
  * /16: This is the subnet mask, which means that the first 16 bits of the address are fixed, and the remaining 16 bits are available for assigning to individual Pods. A /16 subnet provides 65,536 (2^16) available IP addresses.  
* **192.168.0.0/16**:  
  * 192.168.0.0: This IP address is in the private IP address range of 192.168.0.0/16.  
  * /16: This subnet mask, as with 10.244.0.0/16, provides 65,536 available IP addresses.

**Why 10.244.0.0/16 is often preferred:**

* **Convention:** 10.244.0.0/16 is the default pod-network-cidr used by Calico, which is a popular network plugin for Kubernetes. Many guides and tutorials use Calico, so this CIDR has become a common choice. The documentation you provided uses Calico.  
* **Avoiding Conflicts:** The 192.168.0.0/16 range is commonly used in home and small office networks. Using 10.244.0.0/16 reduces the risk of IP address conflicts between your Kubernetes Pod network and the underlying network infrastructure. If your Kubernetes nodes are on a network that also uses 192.168.0.0/16, you would have a routing problem.

**Why not 192.168.0.0/16?**

* **Potential Conflicts:** As mentioned, 192.168.0.0/16 is a very common range for local networks, increasing the chance of overlap.

**In Summary**

While you *could* use 192.168.0.0/16 if you're sure it won't conflict with your network, 10.244.0.0/16 is often the safer and more conventional choice, especially when using Calico. The most important thing is that the pod-network-cidr you choose does not overlap with any other network your nodes can reach.
